# 8.1: The number of books and authors
Implement queries bookCount and authorCount which return the number of books and the number of authors.

The query

``` javascript
query {
  bookCount
  authorCount
}
```

should return

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "bookCount": 7,
    "authorCount": 5
  }
}
```

# 8.2: All books**
Implement query allBooks, which returns the details of all books.**

In the end, the user should be able to do the following query:

```javascript
query {
  allBooks { 
    title 
    author
    published 
    genres
  }
}
```

# 8.3: All authors
Implement query allAuthors, which returns the details of all authors. The response should include a field bookCount containing the number of books the author has written.

For example the query

```javacript
query {
  allAuthors {
    name
    bookCount
  }
}
```

should return

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "allAuthors": [
      {
        "name": "Robert Martin",
        "bookCount": 2
      },
      {
        "name": "Martin Fowler",
        "bookCount": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
        "bookCount": 2
      },
      {
        "name": "Joshua Kerievsky",
        "bookCount": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "Sandi Metz",
        "bookCount": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# 8.4: Books of an author
Modify the allBooks query so that a user can give an optional parameter author. The response should include only books written by that author.

For example query

```javascript
query {
  allBooks(author: "Robert Martin") {
    title
  }
}
```

should return

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "allBooks": [
      {
        "title": "Clean Code"
      },
      {
        "title": "Agile software development"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# 8.5: Books by genre
Modify the query allBooks so that a user can give an optional parameter genre. The response should include only books of that genre.

For example query

```javascript
query {
  allBooks(genre: "refactoring") {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

should return

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "allBooks": [
      {
        "title": "Clean Code",
        "author": "Robert Martin"
      },
      {
        "title": "Refactoring, edition 2",
        "author": "Martin Fowler"
      },
      {
        "title": "Refactoring to patterns",
        "author": "Joshua Kerievsky"
      },
      {
        "title": "Practical Object-Oriented Design, An Agile Primer Using Ruby",
        "author": "Sandi Metz"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The query must work when both optional parameters are given:

```javascript
query {
  allBooks(author: "Robert Martin", genre: "refactoring") {
    title
    author
  }
}
```

# 8.6: Adding a book
Implement mutation addBook, which can be used like this:

```javascript
mutation {
  addBook(
    title: "NoSQL Distilled",
    author: "Martin Fowler",
    published: 2012,
    genres: ["database", "nosql"]
  ) {
    title,
    author
  }
}
```

The mutation works even if the author is not already saved to the server:

```javascript
mutation {
  addBook(
    title: "Pimeyden tango",
    author: "Reijo M채ki",
    published: 1997,
    genres: ["crime"]
  ) {
    title,
    author
  }
}
```

If the author is not yet saved to the server, a new author is added to the system. The birth years of authors are not saved to the server yet, so the query

```javascript
query {
  allAuthors {
    name
    born
    bookCount
  }
}
```

returns

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "allAuthors": [
      // ...
      {
        "name": "Reijo M채ki",
        "born": null,
        "bookCount": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# 8.7: Updating the birth year of an author
Implement mutation editAuthor, which can be used to set a birth year for an author. The mutation is used like so:

```javascript
mutation {
  editAuthor(name: "Reijo M채ki", setBornTo: 1958) {
    name
    born
  }
}
```

If the correct author is found, the operation returns the edited author:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "editAuthor": {
      "name": "Reijo M채ki",
      "born": 1958
    }
  }
}
```

If the author is not in the system, null is returned:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "editAuthor": null
  }
}
```

# 8.8: Authors view
Implement an Authors view to show the details of all authors on a page as follows.

# 8.9: Books view
Implement a Books view to show on a page all other details of all books except their genres.

# 8.10: Adding a book
Implement a possibility to add new books to your application. The functionality can look like this.

Make sure that the Authors and Books views are kept up to date after a new book is added.

In case of problems when making queries or mutations, check from the developer console what the server response is.

# 8.11: Authors birth year
Implement a possibility to set authors birth year. You can create a new view for setting the birth year, or place it on the Authors view.

Make sure that the Authors view is kept up to date after setting a birth year.

# 8.12: Authors birth year advanced
Change the birth year form so that a birth year can be set only for an existing author. Use select tag, react select, or some other mechanism.

A solution using the react select library looks as follows.

# 8.13: Database, part 1
Change the library application so that it saves the data to a database. You can find the mongoose schema for books and authors from here.

Let's change the book graphql schema a little

```javascript
type Book {
  title: String!
  published: Int!
  author: Author!
  genres: [String!]!
  id: ID!
}
```

so that instead of just the author's name, the book object contains all the details of the author.

You can assume that the user will not try to add faulty books or authors, so you don't have to care about validation errors.

The following things do not have to work just yet:

- allBooks query with parameters
- bookCount field of an author object
- author field of a book
- editAuthor mutation

> Note: despite the fact that author is now an object within a book, the schema for adding a book can remain same, only the name of the author is given as a parameter

```javascript
type Mutation {
  addBook(
    title: String!
    author: String!
    published: Int!
    genres: [String!]!
  ): Book!
  editAuthor(name: String!, setBornTo: Int!): Author
}
```

# 8.14: Database, part 2
Complete the program so that all queries (to get allBooks working with the parameter author and bookCount field of an author object is not required) and mutations work.

Regarding the genre parameter of the all books query, the situation is a bit more challenging. The solution is simple, but finding it can be a headache. You might benefit from this.

# 8.15 Database, part 3
Complete the program so that database validation errors (e.g. book title or author name being too short) are handled sensibly. This means that they cause GraphQLError with a suitable error message to be thrown.

# 8.16 user and logging in
Add user management to your application. Expand the schema like so:

```javascript
type User {
  username: String!
  favoriteGenre: String!
  id: ID!
}

type Token {
  value: String!
}

type Query {
  // ..
  me: User
}

type Mutation {
  // ...
  createUser(
    username: String!
    favoriteGenre: String!
  ): User
  login(
    username: String!
    password: String!
  ): Token
}
```

Create resolvers for query me and the new mutations createUser and login. Like in the course material, you can assume all users have the same hardcoded password.

Make the mutations addBook and editAuthor possible only if the request includes a valid token.

(Don't worry about fixing the frontend for the moment.)
