# 2.1: Course information step 6

Let's change the App component like so:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10,
        id: 1
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7,
        id: 2
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14,
        id: 3
      }
    ]
  }

  return <Course course={course} />
}

export default App
```

Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course.

The component structure of the application can be, for example, the following:

```
App
  Course
    Header
    Content
      Part
      Part
      ...
```

Hence, the Course component contains the components defined in the previous part, which are responsible for rendering the course name and its parts.

You don't need the sum of the exercises yet.

The application must work regardless of the number of parts a course has, so make sure the application works if you add or remove parts of a course.

Ensure that the console shows no errors!


# 2.2: Course information step 7
Show also the sum of the exercises of the course.

# 2.3*: Course information step 8
If you haven't done so already, calculate the sum of exercises with the array method reduce.

# 2.4: Course information step 9
Let's extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const courses = [
    {
      name: 'Half Stack application development',
      id: 1,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Fundamentals of React',
          exercises: 10,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Using props to pass data',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        },
        {
          name: 'State of a component',
          exercises: 14,
          id: 3
        },
        {
          name: 'Redux',
          exercises: 11,
          id: 4
        }
      ]
    }, 
    {
      name: 'Node.js',
      id: 2,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Routing',
          exercises: 3,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Middlewares',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

# 2.5: Separate module step10
Declare the Course component as a separate module, which is imported by the App component. You can include all subcomponents of the course in the same module.
